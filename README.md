##Would You Rather Project

Built with creat-react-app and can be run using yarn install and yarn run; 

Project is composed of multiple views-- including a user login, a home page, a leaderboard, an individual question page,
and a create question page. 

Navigating outside of page links requries user sign in. 

Project incorporates redux with react for predictable state management across components. 

Fake database and methods were provided by [starter code from udacity ](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter)
